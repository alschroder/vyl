# This command runs 'vi' against the specified result of the last bash command you ran.
# If no number is specified then it takes the first result
# NOTES: 1. The command is re-run, in order to get the result list again
#        2. There is no header to this file because it needs to run in the same shell
#            as the bash console, otherwise the 'history' command has no access to your
#            console history (because it's a new shell)
